    Model loading is being refactored, so that only a single model will be
    available for serving.
deprecations:
  - Loading the default deepaas-test model if no models are available is now
    marked as deprecated and will be removed in the next major version.
  - Loading several models is now marked as deprecated. If you have several models
    installed, please use the `model-name` configuration option or the
    `--model-name` CLI option.
