features:
  - Allow to specify which arguments the underlying model accepts for the testing
    calls. In this release users can implement a "get_test_args" function in the
    module entry point, allowing to expose those arguments through the API.
fixes:
  - https://jira.deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu/browse/DPD-489
issues:
  - The 0.5.0 version stops passing down the raw data when making a prediction, and 
    passes down the file objects. This breaks backwards compatibility with the 0.4.0 version.
