upgrade:
  - |
    Removed deprecated loading of "deepaas-test" model. If you wish to develop
    or debug your model, use the "demo-app" instead: https://github.com/ai4os-hub/ai4os-demo-app
  - |
    Removed the loading of various models, now only a single model can be served. If you
    have more than one model available in the system please specify a single one via
    the command line option ``--model-name``.
