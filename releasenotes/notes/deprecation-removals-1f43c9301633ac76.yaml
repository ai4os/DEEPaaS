upgrade:
  - |
    Removed deprecated loading of "deepaas-test" model. If you wish to develop
    or debug your model, use the "demo-app" instead: https://github.com/ai4os-hub/ai4os-demo-app
  - |
    Removed the loading of various models, now only a single model can be served. If you
    have more than one model available in the system please specify a single one via
    the command line option ``--model-name``.
  - |
    The /training endpoint has been deprecated. It is no longer possible to
    train a model via the API, as the feature was not widely used and the cost
    of maintaining the code was large. Models relying on this feature will
    still work for prediction.
