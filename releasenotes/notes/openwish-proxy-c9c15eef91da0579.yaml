  - |
    We have added support for running DEEPaaS as an OpenWhisk Docker action.
    When DEEPaaS is invoked via `deepaas-run --openwhisk-detect` it will detect
    if it is running inside an OpenWhisk Docker container, thus it will spawn a
    proxy service that will get the requests and invoke the corresponding model
    function. A new command `deepaas-wsk` is also provided as a command line
    option to force the execution of DEEPaaS in OpenWhisk mode.
