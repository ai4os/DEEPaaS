    """

    schema = None
    """Must contain a valid schema for the model's predictions or None.

    A valid schema is either a ``marshmallow.Schema`` subclass or a dictionary
    schema that can be converted into a schema.

    In order to provide a consistent API specification we use this attribute to
    define the schema that all the prediction responses will follow, therefore:
    - If this attribute is set we will validate them against it.
    - If it is not set (i.e. ``schema = None``), the model's response will
      be converted into a string and the response will have the following
      form::

          {
              "status": "OK",
              "predictions": "<model response as string>"
          }

    As previously stated, there are two ways of defining an schema here. If our
    response have the following form::

        {
            "status": "OK",
            "predictions": [
                {
                    "label": "foo",
                    "probability": 1.0,
                },
                {
                    "label": "bar",
                    "probability": 0.5,
                },
            ]
        }

    We should define or schema as schema as follows:


    - Using a schema dictionary. This is the most straightforward way. In order
      to do so, you must use the ``marshmallow`` Python module, as follows::

        from marshmallow import fields

        schema = {
            "status": fields.Str(
                        description="Model predictions",
                        required=True
            ),
            "predictions": fields.List(
                fields.Nested(
                    {
                        "label": fields.Str(required=True),
                        "probability": fields.Float(required=True),
                    },
                )
            )
        }

    - Using a ``marshmallow.Schema`` subclass. Note that the schema *must* be
      the class that you have created, not an object::

        import marshmallow
        from marshmallow import fields

        class Prediction(marshmallow.Schema):
            label = fields.Str(required=True)
            probability = fields.Float(required=True)

        class Response(marshmallow.Schema):
            status = fields.Str(
                description="Model predictions",
                required=True
            )
            predictions = fields.List(fields.Nested(Prediction))

        schema = Response
    """

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def get_metadata(self):
        """Return metadata from the exposed model.

        The metadata that is expected should follow the schema that is shown
        below. This basically means that you should return a dictionary with
        the following aspect::

            {
                "author": "Author name",
                "description": "Model description",
                "license": "Model's license",
                "url": "URL for the model (e.g. GitHub repository)",
                "version": "Model version",
            }

        If you want to integrate with the deephdc platform you should
        provide at least an [``name``, ``author``, ``author-email``,
         ``license``]. You can nevertheless set them to ``None``
        if you don't feel like providing the information.

        The schema that we are following is the following::

            {
                "id": =  fields.Str(required=True,
                                    description='Model identifier'),

                                          description='Model description'),

                                      description='Model license'),
