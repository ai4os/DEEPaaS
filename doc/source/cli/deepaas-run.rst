Synopsis
========

:program:`deepaas-api` [options]

Description
===========

:program:`deepaas-run` is a server daemon that serves the models that are
   loaded through the ``deepaas.v2.models`` entrypoint API.

Options
=======

.. option:: --debug, -d

   If set to true, the logging level will be set to DEBUG instead of the
   default INFO level.

.. option:: --predict-endpoint

   Specify whether DEEPaaS should provide a train endpoint (default: True).

.. option:: --train-endpoint

   Specify whether DEEPaaS should provide a train endpoint (default: True).

.. option:: --debug-endpoint

   Enable debug endpoint. If set we will provide all the information that you
   print to the standard output and error (i.e. stdout and stderr) through the
   ``/debug`` endpoint. Default is to not provide this information. This will
   not provide logging information about the API itself.

.. option:: --listen-ip LISTEN_IP

   IP address on which the DEEPaaS API will listen. The DEEPaaS API service
   listens on this IP address for incoming requests.

.. option:: --listen-port LISTEN_PORT

   Port on which the DEEPaaS API will listen. The DEEPaaS API service listens
   on this port number for incoming requests.

.. option:: --predict-workers PREDICT_WORKERS, -p PREDICT_WORKERS

   Specify the number of workers to spawn for prediction tasks. If using a CPU
   you probably want to increase this number, if using a GPU probably you want
   to leave it to 1. (defaults to 1)

.. option:: --train-workers TRAIN_WORKERS

   Specify the number of workers to spawn for training tasks. Unless you know
   what you are doing you should leave this number to 1. (defaults to 1)
